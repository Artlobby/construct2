Construct 2
===========

Helpful code and apps for creating games using the Construct 2 game engine.

More coming soon!

## Apps: ##
These two apps requires the pro version of [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/) in order to use Families. They also need the [Windows Phone plugin](https://www.scirra.com/tutorials/593/windows-phone-games-with-construct-2) to be installed in C2 first.

- FlappyFishes: Requires Pro version of Construct 2 in order to use Families.
- LaserPointer: Requires Pro version of Construct 2 in order to use Families.


## Snippets: ##
You can open all of these with the free version of 

- HowToCreateTimer
- HowToDetectDesktopOrMobile
- HowToUseWin8WebStorage


## How To Use ##
Most of the edits for FlappyFishes can be found at the top of `GlobalLevel` event sheet. The variables there allow for the creation of many completely different games. Example on [Windows 8](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/one-click-saga/aac4f149-be49-4381-a4e5-c9c2e4dca723) and [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=0f97417a-bf7c-447d-90f1-a7ea6b7d2f1b).


## License ##
Do whatever you like, as long as the name is changed. (Which you can find at the top of `GlobalCommon` event sheets.)
